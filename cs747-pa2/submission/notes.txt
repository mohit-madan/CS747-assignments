1. 3 states with 2 actions

2. Deterministic actions are chosen so that only rewards are required to be varied in order to satisfy the condition.
3. For action-0 state does not change and for action-1 it goes to states as follows - S_0 --> S_1;S_1 --> S_0;S_2 --> S_1

4. Reward of staying in state 1 set high and leaving it is negative

5. Reward of staying in state-0 and state-2 are lower than state-1. Therefore at high discount factors they will leave their state and move to state-1(state of high reward).

Therefore policy changes as follows:

Discount Factor 	State-0		State-1		State-2

[0.01,0.39]		Stay		Stay		Stay
[0.41,0.74]		Leave		Stay		Stay
[0.76,0.99]		Leave		Stay		Leave
