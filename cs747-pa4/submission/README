1. For Sarsa withought kingsMoves or stochastic wind run:
./evaluate.sh

Plots will obtained at the end after running for 10 iterations

2. For adding kings moves or stochastic wind to the windworld run:

-- only kings moves
./evaluate.sh kingsMoves

-- only stochastic
./evaluate.sh stochastic

-- both kings moves and stochastic
./evaluate.sh kingsMoves stochastic

Both the plots will be plotted one after another i.e on closing the fist plot second one comes
